Lab Requirements and Specifications
-----------------------------------

Here you will be testing your game.

You should name your file ``FILN_rps.py``, where FILN is your first initial and last name, no space.

Testing Your Program

    - You guess the word correctly
    - You guess the word incorrectly

You'll also want to pay special attention to:
    - The game accurately displays the number of guesses remaining
    - The game accurately displays the letters that have been guessed

Here is a sample output:

Lesson 01-08: User Input
========================

**Learning Target: I can write a program to get user input.**

The best kinds of programs are often the interactive ones.  Basic interactivity is easy to implement in python using the ``input`` function.

The ``input()`` Function
------------------------

The built-in ``input()`` function is a way to prompt the user to type something in.  In python, this would be done in the console (where the output is).  On this site, it will appear as a pop-up box.  Run the following code as an example.

.. activecode:: ex_input1
   :nocodelens:
   
   name = input("Hello, what's your name?")
   print("Hello " + name)

Notice how we put the ``input()`` function as part of a **variable reassignment** statement.
